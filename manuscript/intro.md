# About this book

In this book we solve various practical problems using the most performant open-source performance testing framework PerfCake. The best way to get yourself familiar with it is a quick look on the table of contents. The book is available for free and will always be. The sources are [public on GitHub](https://github.com/PerfCake/TheBook). However, we appreciate any donations you make to support our future work.

If you are interested in more details about performance testing, we recommend you our other book Performance Engineering, also [published on LeanPub](http://leanpub.com/perfengineering).

[PerfCake](https://www.perfcake.org/) already comes with detailed [Users' Guide](https://www.perfcake.org/guide/user) 
and [Developers' Guide]((https://www.perfcake.org/guide/devel)). We recommend reading the Users' Guide prior to studying 
this book. We already assume some basic knowledge of PerfCake and performance testing.

We appreciate your feedback and ideas for further scenarios. Please use the [feedback form for this book on LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/perfcake/feedback).
