### SMART Goals

SMART stands for:

Specific
:  Define the goal so it is clear, avoid using ambiguous language. Specify __who__ is involved, __what__ do you want to accomplish, possibly also __where__ it will be done, __why__ do you want to do that, and __which__ constraints, limitations and or requirements do you have.

Measurable
: Can you track the progress and easily measure the progress? How do you know the goal is finished? Set the attributes that can be understood by anybody and cleary judged whether the goal is finished.

Achievable
: Is the goal reasonable enough to be accomplished? Is it realistic? sféry vlivu - věci mimo sféru vlivu Make sure the goal is not out of your reach or below performance.

Relevant
: Is this goal worthwile and does it bring you closer to your desired objective? Is it consistent with the other goals and does it fit your immediate and long-term plans?

Timely
: Your goals should include a certain time limit. For instance _"I will finish this goal by next Tuesday/in two months/this year"_. This establishes a sense of urgency and while sitting deep in your mind, it will prompt you to have a better time management.

G> There will be a lot of tasks throughout this book, so keep a log book!

{lang=java, linenos=on}
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       if (i == 4) {
           System.out.println("Uh oh");
       }
